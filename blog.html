                <p class="text">
                    Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).While most infections result in little or no symptoms, occasional inflammation of the brain occurs.In these cases, symptoms may include headache, vomiting,
                    fever, confusion and seizures.This occurs about 5 to 15 days after infection. JEV is generally spread by mosquitoes, specifically those of the Culex type.Pigs and wild birds serve as a reservoir for the virus.The disease occurs mostly
                    outside of cities.Diagnosis is based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing. Prevention is generally with the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which is both safe and effective.Other measures include avoiding mosquito bites.Once infected,
                    there is no specific treatment, with care being supportive.This is generally carried out in a hospital.Permanent problems occur in up to half of people who recover from JE.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Malaria</h3>
                <p class="text">Malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species
                    P. falciparum and P. vivax pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan
                    Africa. The first symptoms fever, headache and chills usually appear 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite and may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness
                    and death within a period of 24 hours. In 2020, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. Some population groups are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria and developing severe disease: infants, children
                    under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as people with low immunity moving to areas with intense malaria transmission such as migrant workers, mobile populations and travellers.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Jaundice</h3>
                <p class="text">Jaundice is a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues. Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin
                    from the blood to the liver and out of the body can cause jaundice. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver. There are several ways that a build- up of bilirubin can
                    occur: If red blood cells broke down too early, the spleen gets overloaded and hence too much bilirubin is produced to be handled by the liver. Unprocessed bilirubin accumulates in the bloodstream and eventually the skin and eyes looks
                    yellow. This condition is called hemolytic anemia. At times this condition is inherited. Hemolytic anemia may also occur as a side-effect of certain drugs. Sometimes the trouble is in the liver cells. If there is a faulty uptake, processing
                    or excretion of bilirubin it will result in an accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Newborn babies can be temporarily jaundiced because of lack of mature enzymes needed to process bilirubin. In adults, alcoholism is a common
                    cause of damage to liver cells. Other toxins and certain drugs can also cause acute damage to the liver. A blockage in the bile duct can also result in a build-up of fully processed bilirubin. This can spill over into the urine and
                    cause it to become very dark. The blockage is most commonly caused by a gallstone.</p>
